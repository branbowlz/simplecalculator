# Simple Calculator
tis but a simple calculator. it can add, it can subtract, divide and multiply but anything else after that and you'll scare the poor thing off<br />

This is for basic computation and can't do any advanced formulas such as the quadratic equation, differiential equations. It can't read tangent <br>
or anything like that. It's a small guy so go easy on them! <br />

Planned improvements:
<ul>
<li>Add a boolean to loop the project while the user still wants to use the calculator.</li>
</ul>
